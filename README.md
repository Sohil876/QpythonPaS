# QpythonPaS
Some usefull projects and scripts i created for qpython.

SCRIPTS:
    Script runner - Qpython (ATM) does not allows us to launch scripts from terminal directly with arguments, you can use this and launch scripts (currently) in your qpythons script directory by typing full file name with or without arguments, eg. testscript.py, you dont even need file expressions even if your file name has for eg. spaces like test file.py
    PyGame displayinfo - Prints usefull display related infos (display driver,surface,bits,windowing system,available fullscreen modes)
